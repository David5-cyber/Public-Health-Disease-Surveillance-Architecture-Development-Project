# Public-Health-Disease-Surveillance-Architecture-Development-Project
This project simulates a regional healthcare IT architecture using virtual machines, OpenEMR, Synthea, and HAPI-FHIR to support electronic health records, disease outbreak modeling, and real-time public health surveillance. It includes VM setup, EHR deployment, synthetic data generation, FHIR-based data exchange, and dashboard visualization for COVID-19 trends across multiple hospitals
# Architecture Development Part 1: Virtual Machine Configuration/Testing
This project was focused on building a healthcare network using five virtual machines (VMs)â€”four representing hospitals namely;Aspirus Hospital,Portage Health,Baraga County Memorial Hospital,and Marquette General Hospital and one for the Upper Peninsula Health Information Exchange (UPHIE). The hospital VMs will run an OS compatible with OpenEMR, while the UPHIE VM will support HAPI-FHIR. All VMs  shared a common IP scheme to enable seamless connectivity and data exchange. The goal is to create a safe, controlled environment to explore health IT architecture, EMR systems, and interoperability standards like FHIR, bridging classroom concepts with real-world healthcare technology applications.
steps involved in setting up the virtual machine environment:

1.Establishment of a VPN connection

2.Accessed the institution's cluster

3.Navigated the virtual machines

4.Deployed and configured virtual marchines

5.Configured all five(5) virtual machines to operate within the same IP address range and subnet

6.Assigned each virtual machine to a hospital

The table below shows compatibility followed by a screenshot of the virtual machines created
