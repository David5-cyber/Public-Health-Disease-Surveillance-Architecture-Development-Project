# Public-Health-Disease-Surveillance-Architecture-Development-Project
This project simulates a regional healthcare IT architecture using virtual machines, OpenEMR, Synthea, and HAPI-FHIR to support electronic health records, disease outbreak modeling, and real-time public health surveillance. It includes VM setup, EHR deployment, synthetic data generation, FHIR-based data exchange, and dashboard visualization for COVID-19 trends across multiple hospitals
# Architecture Development Part 1: Virtual Machine Configuration/Testing
This project involves setting up a virtual machine (VM) environment to simulate a health information network. It includes five VMsâ€”four representing hospitals and one representing the Upper Peninsula Health Information Exchange (UPHIE). The hospitals will run an OS compatible with OpenEMR, while the UPHIE VM will use one compatible with HAPI-FHIR. All VMs will be connected on a shared IP scheme to enable communication and data exchange, allowing for safe testing of healthcare IT systems before real-world deployment.The table below shows OS compactibility:
